  <h3>What is This Rajma Masala Recipe?</h3>
  <p>
    Rajma is for some the official dish of North India, especially in the Punjab region. Rajma in Hindi
    translates to “kidney beans,” but rajma refers not only to beans but to this curried kidney bean as well!
    Rajma Masala translates to “curried kidney beans in gravy,” which is what I’ll be showing you how to make
    today. This classic Indian kidney bean curry gets its flavours and colour from red kidney beans, ginger,
    garlic and sweet red tomatoes. If you’re in North India, then you know that rajma masala is definitely a
    household favourite! I personally know that I can’t name anyone who doesn’t like rajma, and I’m sure after
    you try this recipe my list will still be blank! Serve this rajma with some rice, crispy potatoes, and breads
    of your choice.

  <h3>Cooking the Rajma</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the rajma in water for at least 4-6 hours.Add rajma to stovetop pressure cooker and add 4 times the volume of water,
        along with salt, cinnamon and clove. Cook for 2-3 whistles on high heat, then turn down the heat to medium and cook for
        15-20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.</li>
    <li>Begin by adding the ginger, garlic, and onion in a food processor with a bit of water. Purée until everything is well
        combined.Heat a pot on medium heat and add ghee/olive oil. When the pot is hot, add hing and cumin seeds. Cook until
        cumin seeds turn reddish brown and aromatic, then add the bay leaf. </li>
    <li>Add onion, ginger, garlic puree. Once the mixture starts to change colour add rajma masala and deggi mirch, mix well 
        and continue cooking until mixture is dry and golden brown. Add a splash of water if mixture gets too dry and starts to stick.</li>
    <li>Puree the tomatoes in a food processor. Add tomato purée and bring to boil. Add 1/2 tsp salt and cook with a lid on until
        the mixture turns redder and becomes dry, about 7-10 minutes. Keep stirring from time to time.</li>
    <li>Add cooked kidney beans along with the reserved cooking water to make a runny gravy. Season with salt and add garam masala
        and mix well. Simmer on medium low heat with the lid on until the gravy starts to thicken. When the gravy is thick,
        remove the lid. Taste and adjust for salt as needed.</li>
    <li>Serve over rice, with potatoes, and/or bread. Garnish with cilantro and enjoy!</li>
