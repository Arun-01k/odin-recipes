  <h3>What is Paneer Bhurji?</h3>
  <p>
    Paneer Bhurji is a popular North Indian dish made from crumbled paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cooked with onions,
    tomatoes, spices, and herbs. “Bhurji” means scrambled, so this is essentially a scrambled paneer dish — spicy,
    savory, and satisfying. It's a go-to recipe for a quick lunch or dinner, often paired with chapati, paratha, or bread.
    It's also commonly served as a filling in wraps or sandwiches.

  <h3>Cooking the Paneer Bhurji</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
    <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Then add green chilies and ginger-garlic paste. Cook until fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft and pulpy. Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Cook the masala until oil starts separating from the sides.</li>
    <li>Add crumbled paneer to the masala. Mix everything well so paneer is coated evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook for 2–3 minutes. Avoid overcooking as paneer can turn rubbery.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle garam masala and chopped cilantro. Give it a final stir and turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with chapati, paratha, or bread. Can also be used in wraps or sandwiches.</li>
